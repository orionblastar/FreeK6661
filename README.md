# FreeK666 

FreeK666 is an attempt at making a free and open source version of Kr5ddit/K666

First stage we build a forum that anonymous users can use.

Then we add in the ability to register an account.

Future changes are adding credits which are earned by being voted up on comments and posts. Then adding subs like Reddit has by using tags.

The exchange will be trading credits for Bitcoin and vice versa. That way trolls are punished with negatvie credits and have to buy more to get back to normal user status.

Credit can be used to push your post to the top of the page. If you collect enough Credits you can sell them for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin and Credit market is based on the stock market.

The goal of this program is to create a forum that rewards users for good content and punishes trolls for bad content. There is an economic reward for posting good materials and some of the Bitcoins will go towards paying the hosting bill. This is a new startup business model that allows a forum to be free and the community moderates itself for reward of Credits.

The FreeK in FreeK666 sounds like Freak or could be short for Frequency or Frequency666 like a radio station or something.

FreeK666 also stands in free speech like in money, it allows people to exercise their free speech and up or down votes from the community determine what gets hidden and what gets shown and what makes it to the front page. So if the community is trolls, it will be troll conetent, if the community are more professional it will be a more professional site. Some of the current alpha testers are from Kuro5hin that had turned into a troll haven and eventually shut down, and from Reddit in which we write from scratch a discussion system which is where the name Kr5ddit comes from. Since SJWs took over Reddit and other sites, people want an alternative that they can run. But this forum is not based on Reddit but one of the goals is for it to replace Reddit and other discussion sites. Free Speech like in money that there are rewards of Kr5ddits to be sold for Bitcoins so the right kind of speech gets economically rewarded. There is also freedom and power given to the community to decide what is shown and what is hidden, instead of moderators and admins deciding what is shown and what is banned like in the Ellen Pao Reddit scandal.
